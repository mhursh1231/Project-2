# Project-2

This repository was created for the UPENN Data Science and Visualization Project 2 ETL challenge.  Together, as the Green Team (Kyle Taveira Tener, Mia Hursh, Michael Pointek, Julius Bzozowski, and Emilio (?)), we created the code to answer the questions asked of us.  Leveraging past examples and course work we successuflly completed the challenge before us.  

For the Jupyter notebook we divided the workload into 3 different parts.
