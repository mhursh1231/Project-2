# Project-2

  This repository was created for the UPENN Data Science and Visualization Project 2 ETL challenge.  Together, as the Green Team (Kyle Taveira Tener, Mia Hursh, Michael Pointek, Julius Bzozowski, and Emilio Kamanousa), we created the code to answer the questions asked of us.  Leveraging past examples and course work we successuflly completed the challenge before us.  

  For the Jupyter notebook we divided the workload into 3 different parts.  Mia Hursh was responsible for extracting the crowd-funding data and cleaning the code to what we needed.  From there Julius Bzozowski created the campaign dataframe with the crowd-funding data.  The extraction of the contacts data and creation of the contacts dataframe was produced by Kyle Taveira Tener.  Once we created the dataframes and the required csv files, Michael Pointek took the csv files and constructed the ERD diagram as well as the corresponding SQL database in pg admin.  From there, Emilio Kamanousa used the information that we created to craft visual representations of the contacts and crowd-funding data to further explain the files given to us.   

For the final jupyter notebook it is the ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_KT code and the crowdfunding_db_
